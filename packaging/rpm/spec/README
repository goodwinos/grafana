The make_webpack.sh script in this directory can be used to create
a webpack tarball of all the nodejs dependencies needed to build a
particular tagged version of grafana, along with the grafana tarball
itself. After running the script, the two tarballs should be copied
to your rpmbuild SOURCES. You can then run a native rpm spec build
using grafana.spec.
